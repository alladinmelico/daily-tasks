## ⚡️ Tools and Architecture
I used Express.js for the Backend since it's very light and easy to install. This is a basic application that which does not require over-engineering. I chose SQLite since I'm just storing all my data in a single table. 

The Frontend uses React. This could also be done using vanilla JS but building Apps using React works faster for me. I also used Tailwind CSS for faster development. 

I created an Integration test to check if all of the endpoints are working as expected.
